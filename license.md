Creative Commons public licenses serve as a worldwide, standardized means to
pre-clear copyright terms for content. They facilitate the sharing of content
to support innovation, education, and research. They promote the compatibility
of combining different resources and the reusability of content. They enable
creators and authors to know their rights when reusing content created by
others.

Public licenses must be enforceable. To meet this requirement, public licenses
offer a balance of freedoms and obligations for creators, authors, and users.
The obligations are designed to facilitate the primary goal: to enable
creators, authors, and users to know their rights when reusing content created
by others.

The licenses grant users certain freedoms to use the licensed content,
including:

- Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
- The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license
terms.

Under the following terms:

- Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the
  license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable
  manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your
  use.

- NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.

- NoDerivatives — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you
  may not distribute the modified material.

- No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological
  measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license
  permits.

Notices:

You do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material in the
public domain or where your use is permitted by an applicable exception or
limitation.

No warranties are given. The license may not give you all of the permissions
necessary for your intended use. For example, other rights such as publicity,
privacy, or moral rights may limit how you use the material.

Creative Commons does not authorize the use of its trademarks, logos, or
official badges without prior written consent. To request permission, contact
